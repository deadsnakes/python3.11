\f1\b [UPDATE: fixed in macOS 13.4] macOS 13 Ventura users
\f0\b0 :  Due to an issue with the macOS 
\f1\b Installer
\f0\b0  app in macOS 13 Ventura updates prior to macOS 13.4, installation of some third-party packages including this Python package may fail with a vague 
\f1\b "The installer encountered an error"
\f0\b0  message if the 
\f1\b Installer
\f0\b0  app does not have permission to access the folder containing the downloaded installer file, typically in the 
\f1\b Downloads
\f0\b0  folder. Go to 
\f1\b System Settings
\f0\b0  -> 
\f1\b Privacy & Security
\f0\b0  -> 
\f1\b Files and Folders
\f0\b0 , then click the mark in front of 
\f1\b Installer
\f0\b0  to expand, and enable 
\f1\b Downloads Folder
\f0\b0  by moving the toggle to the right. See {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103207"}}{\fldrslt https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103207}} for up-to-date information on this issue.  This problem has been resolved in macOS 13.4.\
